Repository containing solved problems from beecrowd in Swift.

## What is beecrowd?
According to their [website](https://www.beecrowd.com.br/judge/pt): "We are a global community of developers committed to keep evolving as students and 
professionals. Train algorithms and programming challenges and become the expert you always dreamed to be." 
<p>It's basically a online judge where you can solve programming problems.</p>

**Important:** beecrowd used to be Uri Online Judge. It's the same plataform, it was just rebranded.

## Repository Organization
Inside the Problems directory, there are directories for a category featured in the website (E.g. Strings). And inside each category directory, the project folders for the solved problems can be found.

### Problems Selection
The problems featured here are selected randomly. Usually i tend to browse problems in the [beecrowd](https://www.beecrowd.com.br/judge/pt) website and solve the ones that i find interesting :)
